Grafana and Prometheus are two widely used tools in the observability and monitoring ecosystem, often used together. While they complement each other, they have distinct purposes:

---

### **Grafana**
- **Purpose**: Visualization and dashboarding tool.
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates highly customizable and interactive dashboards.
  - Supports multiple data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, Elasticsearch, etc.).
  - Alerting and notification capabilities.
  - Rich plugins ecosystem for data visualization and integrations.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions.
- **Use Case**: Best for visualizing metrics, logs, and alerts from different sources in a unified interface.

---

### **Prometheus**
- **Purpose**: Time-series database and monitoring system.
- **Key Features**:
  - Specialized in metrics collection, storage, and querying.
  - Uses its own query language, **PromQL**, for advanced queries.
  - Pull-based architecture for scraping metrics from exporters.
  - Built-in alerting with Alertmanager integration.
  - Scalable for monitoring highly dynamic systems like Kubernetes.
- **Use Case**: Best for collecting and storing metrics data, analyzing trends, and triggering alerts.

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | **Grafana**                         | **Prometheus**                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**   | Visualization and dashboarding      | Metrics collection and storage      |
| **Data Source**        | Integrates with multiple sources    | Native time-series database         |
| **Query Language**     | Supports source-specific queries    | Uses PromQL                         |
| **Alerting**           | Integrated but not standalone       | Built-in with Alertmanager          |
| **Deployment**         | Needs a backend data source         | Functions independently             |

### **When to Use Together**
- **Prometheus** collects and stores metrics, while **Grafana** visualizes them for better insights.
- For example, use Prometheus to monitor system performance metrics and Grafana to create real-time dashboards showcasing those metrics.

If your focus is on building a robust monitoring and visualization setup, using Grafana and Prometheus together provides a comprehensive solution.
